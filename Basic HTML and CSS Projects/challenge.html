              <h2>Swimming Pools</h2>
              <p>Now I done grew up
                Round some people living their life in bottles
                Granddaddy had the golden flask
                Back stroke every day in Chicago
                Some people like the way it feels
                Some people wanna kill their sorrows
                Some people wanna fit in with the popular
                That was my problem
                I was in the dark room
                Loud tunes, looking to make a vow soon
                That I'ma get ****ed up, fillin' up my cup
                I see the crowd mood
                Changing by the minute and the record on repeat
                Took a sip, then another sip, then somebody said to me

              <h2>Looking Out For You</h2>
              <p>I guess I should stop
                Looking out for you
                Like I always do
                When will you
                Start looking out for me too
                Instead of leaving me staring at my shoes
                Just the way you're glancing at me
                Something about you
                Just makes me feel guilty for
                Liking you
                When you're with him
                When you're with him
                This is a love song for a girl
                Who will never know it's about her
                Know it's pretty stupid
                But I'm much too shy to tell her
                She's beaming that smile all the while
                I'm all tripped up on my own throat
                I guess there is no hope
                When you're walking out in the snow
                I say I guess I should go
                And we're talking about someone else
                When we should be talking about ourselves</p>
